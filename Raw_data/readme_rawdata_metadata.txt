(1) The folder "area_mol_sieve" contains one .txt-file per sample with the integrated peak areas of
hydrocarbon compounds after molecular sieve treatment with 5a-cholestane as co-injected standard.

(2) The Excel file "Extinction_Marker_Metadata.xlsx" contains the sheet
"meta_mol" which contains the metadata for the molar sieve-treated
samples.

The sheet contains the following columns:

sample: sample ID
pre/post: sample from pre or post extinction horizon
log_height: height in the log [m]
weight: sample weight used for extraction [g]
TOC: Total organic carbon [%]
a_Chol: area after peak integration with Chromeleon of Cholestane
c_Chol: concentration of Cholestane used as external standard [ng/uL]
v_Chol: volume of Cholestane used as external standard [uL]
v_inject: volumne injected into the FID [uL] 
v_injec_from: volume from which a certain volume was injected into the FID [uL]
TLE: fraction of total lipid extract used for maltene-asphaltene separation [%]
malt: fraction of maltene used for column chromatography [%]
m_malt: mass of 100% of the maltene fraction [mg]
F1: fraction of F1 used for addition of external standard [%]

(3) The Excel file "MPI_raw.xlsx" contains the integrated peak areas of phenanthrene integrated from the
m/z = 178 mass chromatogram, and 1-, 2-, 3- and 9-methylphenanthrene integrated from the m/z = 192 mass
chromatogram.

(4) The Excel file "Extinction_Marker_Global_data.xlsx" contains qualitative supplementary information on the
geographic distribution of C33-n-ACH and phytanyl toluene across paleo-latitudes and ocean basins, including
GPS coordinates for all investigated sites.
